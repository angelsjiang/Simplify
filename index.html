                        Simplicity is a mobile application that simplifies your shop planning process. 
                        It presents all of the promotional deals from the grocery stores of your choice. 
                        It neatly categorizes items for easy searchability and sorts identical products 
                        by the prices offered by your favorite stores. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Simplicity also brings in a simple shopping list feature that allows you to add, 
                        remove, and check off items -- just like you do with pen and paper! Discounted items 
                        added to a list are grouped by stores, so you’ll never forget that one little thing 
                        after leaving the store.
                    </p>

            <div class="row" id="problem">
                <h4 id="probSecTitle">Problem Statement</h4>
                <p>
                    Printed grocery advertisements have been taking passive roles as information providers. 
                    They lie around, perhaps in a stack of similar advertisements from different stores. 
                    Together, they are maybe on a table, maybe in a bin, waiting for a chance to share the 
                    exciting deals they have to offer. That is, if their audience remembered to pick them 
                    up before they expire. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are surrounded by a variety of groceries stores, each offering its best deals through 
                    its own platform. But, we are presented with the problem created by the dispersion of 
                    advertising information. How troublesome is it to price-match the items they need? On 
                    top of this problem, one undeniable reality is that our daily lives are often packed 
                    with all kinds of activities. Price-matching or remembering sales durations may require 
                    time and energy that we can hardly afford, causing inconvenience and introducing 
                    frustrations to our already busy lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To address this series of problems, we first define our essential goal as to develop a 
                    service that helps people save money on groceries. To do that, we conducted a series of 
                    research on experts and on potential users. In the following sections, we will discuss 
                    our methods and findings. Then, we will present the evolution of our design based on 
                    the evidence collected.

            <div class="row" id="audience">
                <h4 id="audSecTitle">Audience</h4>
                <p>
                    The main audience of Simplicity is grocery planners and shoppers. Whether you are making 
                    a list for others, making a list with others, or buying off a list from others, Simplicity 
                    is at your service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By registering for a Simplicity account, the created lists are stored in a cloud database, 
                    making those lists available on any device. However, we understand that some may not want 
                    to open another account (and give themselves just another set of username and password to 
                    remember). As a solution, we also offer the service offline, in hope of helping people of 
                    different concerns and people in different circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Online or offline, Simplicity prompts you to select a list of their go-to stores. That way, 
                    the contents shown are always tailored to your preferences, and information from stores that 
                    you don’t go to will stay out of your way. Since the service only supports English and 
                    searches for your nearby stores using a U.S. zip code, this application is primarily assisting 
                    English speakers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since Simplicity is only available on smartphones, two assumptions that we have about our 
                    audience are: they are comfortable with navigating and operating technologies, and they have 
                    access to the internet.

                    The scope of the Simplicity project includes:
                    <ul id="paragraphList">
                        <li>Problem identification</li>
                        <li>Project management</li>
                        <li>Competitive analysis</li>
                        <li>User research and persona creation</li>
                        <li>User story design and wireframe construction</li>
                        <li>Usability testing and heuristic evaluation</li>
                        <li>High fidelity mockup construction</li>
                        <li>Final showcase and case study compilation</li>
                        <li>Appropriate deliverables to our stakeholders at the end of each process</li>
                    </ul>
                    There are two significant constraints: time and budget. From problem identification to the final 
                    howcase, the project spanned a total of three months, from March 29th to June 9th of 2021. Without 
                    a budget, the team relied solely on free online collaboration tools:
                    <ul id="paragraphList">
                        <li>Google’s cloud-native tools (Drive, Docs, Slides, and Sheets) for content compilation</li>

                        <li>Trello for project management</li>
                        <li>Discord and Slack for team and stakeholder communications</li>

                                Having decided to work on a solution to resolve our shop-planning frustrations, the 
                                team brainstormed on several problems that can be addressed. As a result of our 
                                brainstorming session, we identified possible user needs, our initial ideas, the 
                                activities necessary to accomplish our research objectives, and the final product 
                                we wish to deliver.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We hypothesized that shop-planning frustrations may be caused by the scatter of 
                                sales information from grocery stores. This sales information may be printed or 
                                digital, but both forms share a similarity: they are often presented in a passive 
                                manner. That is, they are lying there and waiting to be read. This presentation 
                                introduces some inconvenience to people, especially those whose daily schedule is 
                                often preoccupied by many activities. As a result, people need to actively search 
                                for and collect these sales information. In addition, they need to actively keep 
                                in mind the duration of specific sales in order to get the products they want at 
                                the price they desire. With those burdens, people tend to miss the sales information 
                                and the optimal shopping time. So, we want to help shoppers save money and relieve 
                                the stress built during this process.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With the problems discovered and the essence stated, we believed there could be 
                                a solution that combines both information collection and presentation in an active, 
                                unaggressive way. Our goals for our project are to ultimately effectively address 
                                this need and to assist users so they don’t miss the sale items they are interested in.

                                In our competitive analysis, we explored the market and discovered existing services 
                                that propose solutions to our overarching research goal. We looked at direct and indirect 
                                competitors. We learned about their target audience, the unique services that they offer, 
                                the things that they are doing right, and the things they are not doing right. In this 
                                section, we will briefly compare three competitors, two of which are direct competitors 
                                and the other indirect.

                                To understand our audience, we developed an interview protocol and recruited nine 
                                participants of varying cultural and educational backgrounds. Asking open-ended and 
                                closed-ended questions, we learned about their personal experiences on both the 
                                planning and the shopping process. When we shared our findings among the team, we 
                                realized surprisingly many commonalities in practice between the participants, despite 
                                their diverse backgrounds.

                                Some reappearing factors that shaped the interviewees’ shopping habits include store 
                                distance, store specialities, weekly sales, and product prices. Of the twenty groups 
                                created during the construction of the affinity diagram, there were several that confirmed 
                                our hypotheses raised in the project proposal. They are:
                                <ul id="paragraphList">
                                    <li>I don’t read physical advertisements</li>
                                    <li>Sales are very important to me</li>
                                    <li>I don’t actively look for sales information</li>
                                </ul>
                                Other popular opinions among the interviewees that will affect our product design include:
                                <ul id="paragraphList">
                                    <li>I use the built-in notes application on my phone to make my shopping list</li>
                                    <li>I plan what to buy before my trip, though it may not take a physical form</li>
                                    <li>I don’t usually use tools in my grocery shopping process</li>
                                    <li>I change my plans depending on what is on sale</li>
                                    <li>I use the store’s website or mobile application to look up sales information</li>
                                    <li>I am convinced to buy the products that are on sale</li>
                                </ul>

                                <br>
                                All but one of our interviewees are young adults at the age range of 20 to 30 years old. 
                                Having only one interviewee in her 50s may cause our results to be heavily skewed towards 
                                the younger demographic. 
                                <br>
                                The academic background of our interviewees includes: user experience design, computer 
                                science, biological science, economy, and more. All of the interviewees had an occupation 
                                at the time when the interviews were conducted, and some had plans to further develop their 
                                academic careers. 
                                <br>
                                The gender ratio in our interview is roughly 1 to 1; we interviewed four females and five 
                                males. We also asked about their families as we expected their answers to affect their 
                                shopping habits.
                                <br>
                                While none of our interviewees has kids, we found from both our lives and from research 
                                done on parents’ shopping behaviors (https://www.fluentco.com/blog/moms-shopping-habits/), 
                                which differs from the data that we collected. The research proved that being a parent, or 
                                more specifically a mother, largely impacts one’s lifestyle. Therefore, this is an important 
                                factor in diversifying opinions and feedback on information gathering and grocery shopping 
                                experiences. We will be taking parenthood into consideration in our product design.

                                Four out of nine interviewees reported that they usually plan their shopping lists before 
                                they head to the grocery store. However, it is important to emphasize that three of those 
                                four also mentioned that they often purchase products that are not on their shopping lists.

                                While most of our interviewees expressed that the price of the products will affect their 
                                decisions, how they react to prices can be divided into three groups:

                                Four out of nine interviewees mentioned that they use the built-in notes application on their 
                                phone to build their shopping list, although one of the four specified that he only uses it when 
                                there are too many things to buy. 
                                <br>
                                Six out of nine interviewees reported that they do not read physical advertisements. While one 
                                of the six interviewees explained that it is because she rarely receives them, the others thought 
                                negatively of physical advertisements. 
                                <br>
                                Four interviewees, three of whom do not read physical advertisements, mentioned that they use 
                                the store’s websites or mobile applications to look up sales information. Two interviewees mentioned 
                                that they have tried third-party services before, but they no longer use them because of varying 
                                pain points.

These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.

                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum 
                    has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer 
                    took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not 
                    only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially 
                    unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing 
                    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
                    including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
