                        Simplicity is a mobile application that simplifies your shop planning process. 
                        It presents all of the promotional deals from the grocery stores of your choice. 
                        It neatly categorizes items for easy searchability and sorts identical products 
                        by the prices offered by your favorite stores. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Simplicity also brings in a simple shopping list feature that allows you to add, 
                        remove, and check off items -- just like you do with pen and paper! Discounted items 
                        added to a list are grouped by stores, so you’ll never forget that one little thing 
                        after leaving the store.

                <p>
                    Printed grocery advertisements have been taking passive roles as information providers. 
                    They lie around, perhaps in a stack of similar advertisements from different stores. 
                    Together, they are maybe on a table, maybe in a bin, waiting for a chance to share the 
                    exciting deals they have to offer. That is, if their audience remembered to pick them 
                    up before they expire. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are surrounded by a variety of groceries stores, each offering its best deals through 
                    its own platform. But, we are presented with the problem created by the dispersion of 
                    advertising information. How troublesome is it to price-match the items they need? On 
                    top of this problem, one undeniable reality is that our daily lives are often packed 
                    with all kinds of activities. Price-matching or remembering sales durations may require 
                    time and energy that we can hardly afford, causing inconvenience and introducing 
                    frustrations to our already busy lives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To address this series of problems, we first define our essential goal as to develop 
                    <strong id="specialPhrases_1"><i>a service that helps people save money on groceries</i></strong>
                    To do that, we conducted a series of research on experts and on potential users. In 
                    the following sections, we will discuss our methods and findings. Then, we will present 
                    the evolution of our design based on the evidence collected.
                </p>

            <hr />
            <div class="row" id="audience">
                <h3 id="audSecTitle">Audience</h3>
                <p>
                    The main audience of Simplicity is grocery planners and shoppers. Whether you are making 
                    a list for others, making a list with others, or buying off a list from others, Simplicity 
                    is at your service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By registering for a Simplicity account, the created lists are stored in a cloud database, 
                    making those lists available on any device. However, we understand that some may not want 
                    to open another account (and give themselves just another set of username and password to 
                    remember). As a solution, we also offer the service offline, in hope of helping people of 
                    different concerns and people in different circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Online or offline, Simplicity prompts you to select a list of their go-to stores. That way, 
                    the contents shown are always tailored to your preferences, and information from stores that 
                    you don’t go to will stay out of your way. Since the service only supports English and 
                    searches for your nearby stores using a U.S. zip code, this application is primarily assisting 
                    English speakers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since Simplicity is only available on smartphones, two assumptions that we have about our 
                    audience are: they are comfortable with navigating and operating technologies, and they have 
                    access to the internet.

                    The team behind Simplicity consists of Shulin “Angel” Jiang, Mandy Tsai, and Zitian Li. We are 
                    software engineering students with varying academic backgrounds, including Pharmacological 
                    Chemistry, Informatics, and Social Science. Having shared frustration on shop planning, we 
                    decided to work together and design a solution that may end our concerns once and for all. 
                    Throughout the research and development process, the members contributed their best efforts 
                    to deliver the prototype of Simplicity. 
                    <br><br>
                    The stakeholders of this project include Professor Matthew J Bietz, Agnes Romhanyi, and Dennis 
                    Wang. Throughout the project life, they continue to provide insights, guidance, and professional 
                    feedback to the team to bring forth the most suitable solution for our audience.

                    The scope of the Simplicity project is as follows:
                    <ul id="paragraphList_1">
                        <li>Problem identification</li>
                        <li>Project management</li>
                        <li>Competitive analysis</li>
                        <li>User research and persona creation</li>
                        <li>User story design and wireframe construction</li>
                        <li>Usability testing and heuristic evaluation</li>
                        <li>High fidelity mockup construction</li>
                        <li>Final showcase and case study compilation</li>
                        <li>Appropriate deliverables to our stakeholders at the end of each process</li>
                    </ul>
                    There are two significant constraints: time and budget. From problem identification to the final 
                    howcase, the project spanned a total of three months, from March 29th to June 9th of 2021. Without 
                    a budget, the team relied solely on free online collaboration tools:
                    <ul id="paragraphList_2">
                        <li>Google’s cloud-native tools (Drive, Docs, Slides, and Sheets) for content compilation</li>

                                Having decided to work on a solution to resolve our shop-planning frustrations, the 
                                team brainstormed on several problems that can be addressed. As a result of our 
                                brainstorming session, we identified possible user needs, our initial ideas, the 
                                activities necessary to accomplish our research objectives, and the final product 
                                we wish to deliver.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We hypothesized that shop-planning frustrations may be caused by the scatter of 
                                sales information from grocery stores. This sales information may be printed or 
                                digital, but both forms share a similarity: they are often presented in a passive 
                                manner. That is, they are lying there and waiting to be read. This presentation 
                                introduces some inconvenience to people, especially those whose daily schedule is 
                                often preoccupied by many activities. As a result, people need to actively search 
                                for and collect these sales information. In addition, they need to actively keep 
                                in mind the duration of specific sales in order to get the products they want at 
                                the price they desire. With those burdens, people tend to miss the sales information 
                                and the optimal shopping time. <strong id="specialPhrases_2"><strong>So, we want to help shoppers save money and relieve
                                the stress built during this process</strong></strong>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With the problems discovered and the essence stated, we believed there could be 
                                a solution that combines both information collection and presentation in an active, 
                                unaggressive way. Our goals for our project are to ultimately effectively address 
                                this need and to assist users so they don’t miss the sale items they are interested in.

                                    competitors. We learned about their target audience, the unique services that they

                                    To understand our audience, we developed an interview protocol and recruited nine
                                    participants of varying cultural and educational backgrounds. Asking open-ended and
                                    closed-ended questions, we learned about their personal experiences on both the
                                    planning and the shopping process. When we shared our findings among the team, we
                                    realized surprisingly many commonalities in practice between the participants,
                                    despite
                                    their diverse backgrounds.

                                    Some reappearing factors that shaped the interviewees’ shopping habits include store
                                    distance, store specialities, weekly sales, and product prices. Of the twenty groups
                                    created during the construction of the affinity diagram, there were several that
                                    confirmed
                                    our hypotheses raised in the project proposal. They are:

                                All but one of our interviewees are young adults at the age range of 20 to 30 years old.
                                Having only one interviewee in her 50s may cause our results to be heavily skewed
                                towards
                                the younger demographic.

                                The academic background of our interviewees includes: user experience design, computer
                                science, biological science, economy, and more. All of the interviewees had an
                                occupation
                                at the time when the interviews were conducted, and some had plans to further develop
                                their
                                academic careers.

                                The gender ratio in our interview is roughly 1 to 1; we interviewed four females and
                                five
                                males. We also asked about their families as we expected their answers to affect their
                                shopping habits.

                                While none of our interviewees has kids, we found from both our lives and from

                                which differs from the data that we collected. The research proved that being a parent,
                                or
                                more specifically a mother, largely impacts one’s lifestyle. Therefore, this is an

                                experiences. We will be taking parenthood into consideration in our product design.

                                a priority and described at least one scenario as a resolution for each story.

                                After the creation of our user stories, we designed our first wireframes and included

                                To resolve the first user story shared above, we decided to combine the scenarios and to 
                                display a message that reminds the user if the sale is almost over. To resolve the second 
                                user story, we display all of the prices offered by the stores that the user subscribes to 
                                and sort the results by price in ascending order. Finally, to resolve the third user story, 
                                we combined the scenarios and gave users the choice to manually enter a zip code or to use 
                                the information captured by the device’s built-in location service.

                                    In the usability test, or user evaluation, process, we recruited seven participants to test 
                                    the first version of our wireframes. We developed a protocol consisting of five specific goal 
                                    oriented tasks, a broad reflective task, and some general closing questions. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    These five tasks allow the participants to explore the main functionalities of the application. 
                                    The order of the tasks was designed so that the participants explored through as many screens 
                                    as possible. More specifically, the participants must go through at least three screens to 
                                    complete each task. In this process, we asked them to think out loud as they interact with the 
                                    wireframe and interrupted as little as possible.

                                    From the concluding questions, we got a lot of suggestions about how they wished the application 
                                    could be improved upon. As a team, we gathered our analyzed data and shared our insights to discuss 
                                    how the wireframe can be improved. We created a list of issues to be resolved, assigned a priority 
                                    to each issue, and designed a solution for each issue.

                                    The members first completed the evaluation individually. This freed the members from each 
                                    other’s constraints and encouraged them to think in their own creative ways.

                                    After all of the members completed their individual evaluations, we discussed each issue that 
                                    we discovered and shared insights on possible solutions. Similar to the usability testing process, 
                                    we assigned a priority to and decided on a solution to adopt for each issue.

                <p>
                    The outcome of this project is an interactive prototype that is ready to be implemented. The team 
                    is satisfied with and proud of the outcome. 
                    <br><br>
                    The team learned a lot of things from this project. Some of the most important lessons include the 
                    general evolution of a system’s user interface and experience design. The research done for this 
                    project is unlike any previous courses taken with the Master of Software Engineering program at 
                    UC Irvine. This course helped us learn how much it takes to construct a good user experience and 
                    how potential users’ feedback may contradict our imagination and assumptions as we design. 
                    <br><br>
                    Some of the challenges we faced include team and participant availability. Because the team had 
                    other responsibilities of other courses, the team was not able to spend forty hours per week (as 
                    if this were a work project) on this project. That often led to delayed replies to text messages 
                    and piled up work over the weekends. At the same time, participant availability had also postponed 
                    some informal deadlines that we set for ourselves, making last minute meetings necessary at times.
                    <br><br>
                    If we had extra resources, we would like to recruit a significant number of randomly selected 
                    participants, so our data is representative of the population. Because of the time constraint, 
                    we were only able to reach out to several participants. Because of the resource constraint, we were 
                    only able to reach out to people we know. These two factors prevented our research results from 
                    being representative of the audience this application is designed for.
